This little library provides an alternative Double-Linked List to the one on the STL.

It has various useful methods to make your life easier:

  * Access by index to the elements if needed (I hope you dont hate me for this).
  * range-based for loop support (as espected).
  * Reverse methods.
  * Full-usage of r-value references.
  * Insertion and extraction operators overloading for a stack behavior.
  * Iterator pattern (as espected).
  * Index-based insertion and deletion operations.
  * Concatenation of lists - At the end or the begining - Option for movements
